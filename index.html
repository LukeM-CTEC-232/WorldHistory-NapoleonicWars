<h2>THE NAPOLEONIC WARS</h2>
<body>
<b>
<h3>
The Napoleonic Wars was a turning point in history, because it remade the map of Europe, and set up Germany and Italy to emerge as unified states. It also led to South America getting its independence from Spain. It was also the war that finally toppled Napoleonâ€™s French Empire. Napoleon in of himself was a turning point in history, in which the fact he led the French empire makes this all the more of a turning point in history. Napoleon also sold the United States the Lousiana Purchase to fund the war. More information on the Napoleonic Wars can be found on the Britanica Website.

<h3>
The Lousiana Purchase single-handedly doubled the size of the young United States which would eventually become a world power. Newspapers say that the purchase saved the US from having to forcefully seize it.
</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
South America was able to get its independence because Spain was politically unstable during the time period of the war, which gave South America a window of opportunity to push Spain out while they were distracted fighting.
</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
Germany and Italy were able to emerge as unified states because of the Congress of Vienna which aimed to fix the map of Europe post-fall of the french empire.
